<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
SuperScope is an image analysis tool that is able to recognize a video game that is being scanned by the camera of your mobile phone and give you a recommendation score based on what you've played in the past by using image recognition and KMeans clustering.

The review scores are provided by [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/about-metacritic), a website at aiming to summarize the many entertainment reviews available for a movie or a video game into a single score. The box-art images used for recognition are composed of images provided by [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/). I couldn't have realised this project without their help.
